# 👋 Hi, I’m @electric-socket
My name is Paul. I had to pick this name because all the others I tried were in use. Then I saw the electric socket on the wall, and... 
an account was born!
# 👀 I’m interested in ...
Pascal compilers - especially self-hosting ones - and Pascal tools. 
# 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
Object Pascal and its differences. The basic concepts of unit compilation and separate unit variables and procedure/function ones I'm familiar 
with. You have that in a main program. But objects with methods, properties, separate variables is taking a bit of work to get used to it. 
It's sort of like a RECORD with procedures and functions.
# 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
Specifically a Pascal cross-reference tool.
# 📫 How to reach me ...
